Build Responsibly:
The Meta Code
of Conduct
A foundation for keeping people safe
and making a positive impact

Meta Code of Conduct:
Helping us work and
build responsibly
Meta is built to accomplish an
important mission: to build the
future of human connection and the
technology that makes it possible.
Our reach and influence require that we commit and hold ourselves
accountable to a high standard, ensuring that we build products and
programs that have a positive impact, keep people safe and serve everyone.
The Code of Conduct is our foundation. It helps everyone who works at Meta
understand the responsibilities we have and empowers them to act
responsibly. It explains some of the legal rules we must abide by as well as the
high standard to which we hold ourselves. While it does not cover every
situation you may face in your daily work, the Code of Conduct should be your
first stop when you face an unclear or difficult decision.

A message from
Mark Zuckerberg
At Meta, we build the future of
human connection and the
technology that makes it possible.
With that comes a deep responsibility to each other, to the communities we serve and
to the world. I believe that embracing this responsibility allows us to innovate better—
and be a better company.
This Code of Conduct defines the expectations we have for how we act and how we
make decisions. We should look to it when we have questions or face difficult tradeoffs and gray areas.
The importance of our work means we must all commit to holding ourselves to a high
standard. This is why I expect everyone at Meta— leaders, managers, individual
contributors, contingent workers—to follow our Code of Conduct, advocate for others
to do the same, and feel empowered to speak up if you need help or have questions.
Let’s use this Code of Conduct to build responsibly.
Thank you,
Mark

Our principles
are foundational
to Meta
The Code of Conduct is built on our
principles, which are beliefs that we
hold deeply and represent what we
stand for. They help guide how we
make decisions every day.
Five principles guide
our work at Meta:
1
Give people a voice—we build products and programs so
everyone can use their voice—to tell their stories, to share,
to connect, to be heard and to change their lives for the better.
2
Build connection and community—because we believe in
the potential of people when they can come together, we
are committed to helping people connect.
3
Serve everyone—if you believe in the potential of people,
you need to make sure you provide the same opportunities
to everyone.
4
Keep people safe and protect privacy—we are committed to
protecting our communities from harm.
5
Promote economic opportunity—people use our tools every
day to come together to unlock potential and drive economic
opportunity in their own lives, within their communities and for
their organizations.

Speaking up and
getting help 1/2
Your voice matters.
Speaking up is important if you see or suspect a
violation of the law, this Code or any of Meta’s
policies. You don’t need to have all the information or
details to ask questions or speak up.
You should feel comfortable asking a question or
reporting a concern using whatever channel or
resource you prefer. You can trust that your question
or concern will be treated seriously and dealt with
promptly and as confidentially as possible.
You can always raise your concern with:
• Your manager or
another manager
• Legal or a member of the
Corporate Compliance &
Ethics team
• Your Employee Relations
(ER) Business Partner
• Internal Audit
• For privacy-related concerns,
the Privacy Report Tool
• For Contingent Workers, through your company’s issue
escalation process and/or HR Point of Contact (POC)
• You can also submit a report via SpeakUp, Meta’s
concern reporting system, which in many cases
allows for anonymous reporting:
‐ Visit fb.integrityline.com
‐ Call +1-877-564-9619
‐ Dial the direct access code available at
business.att.com/collateral/access.html and
then +1-877-564-9619 following the
operator’s instructions
For more information on available resources and anonymous reporting options, visit the
Whistleblower and Complaint Policy.
If you have questions about the Code, need advice on a particular topic or issue or are
unsure about how to report a concern, please visit the Compliance & Ethics Hub (for FTEs)
or People Portal Contingent Workforce page or CWquestions@ (for CWs) for support.

What happens next:
investigations
When Meta learns about a potential violation
of law, this Code or any of Meta’s policies,
the Company will take action. This often
includes conducting a fair, objective and
thorough investigation. Meta will make
every effort to get all sides of the story
in a timely, impartial way and maintain
confidentiality to the greatest extent
possible and in compliance with applicable
laws and regulations.
To ensure that we can conduct a meaningful
investigation, you are obligated to participate in
Company investigations when asked, comply
with confidentiality requirements when
advised, be truthful and honest, and fully
answer the questions asked.
If we determine that a violation occurred or
someone was untruthful in the course of an
audit or investigation, we take appropriate
action, including disciplinary action up to
termination, financial consequences, and, if
necessary, referral to law enforcement.
No tolerance
for retaliation
Speaking up is not always easy, but it is
always the right thing to do and what we
expect at Meta. That is why under the
Whistleblower and Complaint Policy, we
do not tolerate retaliation against anyone
who:
• Raises a concern in good faith about a
possible violation of the law, this Code or
Company policies, expresses an intent to
do so or assists other Meta Personnel in
doing so
• Participates in an investigation
Working with
compliance and
ethics teams at Meta
Meta’s compliance teams, Product Compliance
& Privacy and Corporate Compliance & Ethics,
are partners to everyone at Meta for navigating
the complexities of today and anticipating
those coming tomorrow.
Product Compliance & Privacy focuses on product
compliance and provides risk oversight and
compliance related to privacy, integrity, and
security. Corporate Compliance & Ethics serves as
the generalist compliance function responsible for
managing risks outside of integrity, security, and
privacy, focusing on key risks that arise out of
Meta’s corporate and financial engagements.
The Corporate Compliance & Ethics team offers
the Compliance & Ethics Hub including tools,
resources, compliance contacts, and guidance on
how to make responsible decisions at Meta. Do not
hesitate to reach out via the Compliance & Ethics
Hub to raise a concern or ask for support.

Diversity
at Meta
At Meta, one way we support building the future of
human connection and the technology that makes it
possible is by leveraging our cognitive diversity to
build better products for the global community we
serve. Our strategies are anchored in People
functions which improve our systems of hiring,
retention, and development.
The People work ladders up to Product where teams
from a wide range of backgrounds, experiences and
perspectives focus on the experience of diverse
users, helping us build products that serve everyone.
Diversity at Meta means we:
• Strive to promote fair and equal opportunities in all aspects of recruitment and employment
• Are respectful of the differences between people and their circumstances and do not
tolerate discrimination or harassment on the basis of any legally protected characteristics
• Welcome ideas, opinions, and ways of thinking that may be different from our own and
prohibit exclusionary behaviors, which may include bullying and workplace violence and
isolating individuals and groups
• Foster an inclusive and respectful workplace by assessing our conscious and unconscious
biases, removing barriers to equal opportunity, focusing on consistency and fairness in our
people processes and Company procedures
• Encourage allyship and standing up for others

Meta’s diversity strategy
Across our core find, grow and keep, and Product pillars, and with the help of the people that
we hire and retain, we will continue to push the frontier by inventing and developing the
foundational technologies that will make the next generation of experiences possible.
Find
To build cognitively diverse teams, we hire highly
qualified individuals from the widest range of
backgrounds and experiences. This helps us benefit
from each other’s vast variety of experiences and
perspectives and offer products and services truly
designed for all.
Grow and keep
Support professional development and run a fair
performance process so people can grow in their
careers. We help people who work here expand their
skill sets – including their capabilities to build inclusive
team environments where everyone is seen, heard and
valued. Meta must be a space where everyone is
welcome and has the opportunity to succeed.
Build better products
To build products that serve everyone and promote
economic opportunity, we must apply diverse
perspectives to everything we do. Our goal is to build
products that have universal impact. To do so, we
leverage the cognitive diversity of the people who
work at Meta to provide strategic input on our
products, policies, programs and practices and apply
those learnings to build for all.

Be respectful
We have a responsibility to maintain a
respectful and inclusive community,
which is shaped by the experiences
people have working at Meta every day.
It is important that Meta Personnel feel valued
and respected and that they are treated fairly at
work and work-related events, whether in-person
or virtual. Sharing, providing feedback, and
questioning, all with respect, are core to our
culture and key to our mission.
This culture helps us make informed decisions and
have a meaningful impact in the world. Meta does not
tolerate harassment, discrimination, threats, bullying,
retaliation or any similar behavior against anyone.
Being respectful means we:
• Treat every person within our community with respect, regardless of role, position,
seniority, employment status or tenure
• Consider the needs and perspectives of others and how our words and
actions might be received
• Never threaten, act violently toward or harass others, including sexually
• Don’t insult, bully, disparage, shame or mock others and stay vigilant for signs that
others are being harassed or bullied
• Don’t retaliate against others—everyone should foster a culture in which anyone can
comfortably raise a concern without fear
• Speak up about anything that may violate Meta’s respectful work environment policies
(remember, managers are required to promptly report actual or potential violations of
the Harassment Policy, ideally within 24 hours)

What is harassment?
Harassment is conduct, connected to a protected characteristic, that creates
a disrespectful, intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive
environment. It is never tolerated at Meta. Remember: harassment is about
impact—how others perceive an action, not intent. For example, it can be:
What a person says or writes, including slurs,
jokes, or stereotyping as well as threatening,
or abusive language or behavior, based on protected
characteristics such as race, sexual orientation
or gender
What a person does, such as unwelcome touching,
making sexual advances, blocking someone’s
walking path, ignoring someone or deliberately
humiliating someone
What a person displays, such as displaying lewd
photos or derogatory slogans in the workplace or
sharing them electronically. This also includes sharing
discriminatory or inappropriate posts about someone
with someone else.
Q:
My new manager is outgoing and inquisitive. They may think
they’re being friendly, but their probing questions about my
personal life make me feel uncomfortable. In our first 1:1 they
asked me whether I was married and had children. I assumed they
were trying to get to know me better and build our relationship,
but in my culture, it is not common to discuss your personal life
with colleagues. I avoided their question, but at a recent team
social they asked me again in front of a group. I responded that I
prefer not to discuss my personal life at work. They said, “If you’re
so uptight, you might not be a good fit for this team. You’re in the
US now and we just want to get to know you a little better.” I told
the team about my family circumstances but was really
embarrassed by the comment my manager made.
What can I do?
A:
While your manager may have had good intent, you should not be
made to feel uncomfortable or embarrassed, particularly after
making it clear that you don’t want to discuss your personal life.
There is no place for this at Meta. We focus on the impact of a
comment or action rather than the intent. Reach out to another
manager, Legal, your HR Business Partner or Employee Relations
Business Partner, or contact SpeakUp, to discuss your concerns
further. Any of these options will enable us to help resolve the
issue. You will be protected from any retaliation.

META CULTURE

Working at Meta means making every connection matter

Connection is at the center of our mission to build the future of human connection and the technology that makes it possible. And we live that mission from the inside out. That means we act with intention to build and reinforce strong connections with each other, our work and our shared goals as a company.


We believe in doing career-defining work

Our culture is one of high impact, high performance and high reward, and our community is built of many of the brightest and most innovative minds in tech. We’re passionate, tenacious and adaptable with a strong desire to deliver work that matters and that helps expand human connection in new ways.


WHO WE ARE


Collaborative innovators

We work as a team and exchange ideas, expecting meaningful feedback from each other and learning from the best in their field.


Original thinkers

We value unique ideas that push us to break through what's possible and deliver work that makes a difference.


Thoughtful risk-takers

We don’t shy away from change and ambiguity — in fact, we see it as an opportunity to try something new.

Our core values define who we are

At Meta, core values aren’t just words on a piece of paper. They’re what guide our actions, communication and decisions every day.


Move fast

We build and learn faster than anyone else. Acting with urgency, we don’t wait until next week to do something we could do today. We continuously work to speed up our highest priority initiatives by methodically removing barriers that get in the way. It’s about moving fast in one direction together — as a company and as individuals.


Build awesome things

We push ourselves to ship things that are not just good, but also awe-inspiring. We’ve already built technologies that are useful to billions of people. In our next chapter, we’ll focus more on inspiring them as well, in everything we do.


Be direct and respect your colleagues

We create a culture where we are straightforward and willing to have hard conversations with each other. At the same time, we are also respectful and when we share feedback, we recognize that many of the world’s leading experts work here.


Focus on long-term impact

We emphasize long-term thinking that encourages us to extend the timeline for the impact we have, rather than optimizing for near-term wins. We take on the challenges that will be the most impactful, even if the full results won’t be seen for years.


Live in the future

We build the future of work that we want, with an in-person focus designed to support a strong, valuable experience for our people who work from the office, and a thoughtful and intentional approach to where we invest in remote work. This also means being early adopters of the future products we build to help people feel present together wherever they are.


Meta, Metamates, me

We are stewards of our company and our mission. We have a sense of responsibility for our collective success and to each other as teammates. It’s about taking care of our company and each other.


IN THEIR OWN WORDS

“There’s this strong culture of collaboration and transparency that I’ve never seen before.”

— Mai H., Software Engineer

Our principles

They embody what we stand for and guide our approach to how we build technology for people and their relationships.


Give people a voice



Build connection and community



Serve everyone



Keep people safe and protect property



Promote economic opportunity

Our tools level the playing field so businesses grow, create jobs and strengthen the economy.

ACCESSIBILITY AND ENGAGEMENT AT META

Build community and products for all

Bringing people from varied backgrounds and experiences together allows us to create technologies that break down language barriers, make better business decisions and connect communities around the world.


We build to serve everyone
Our standardized approach involves Meta experts teaming up with community members to integrate varied perspectives. This helps us create technologies that reflect the needs of billions of people across the globe.


Creating technologies to assist people with disabilities

Technology should be accessible to everyone, including people with disabilities. Our AI-enabled technologies make daily living easier, from speech-to-text tools for the hearing impaired to visual enhancements for those with vision impairments.


Using AI to bridge language gaps

Many of our technologies offer translation features like natural language processing, multilingual AI support models and adaptive learning programs to break down language barriers and streamline communication.


IN THEIR OWN WORDS

“We remain committed to building products that serve billions of people across the world. To achieve this, we need as many different voices as we can get on every team. A broad range of perspectives enable stronger teams.”

-Maxine Williams, Vice President, Accessibility and Engagement

Employee resource groups
Meta Employee Resource Groups (MRGs) build community and provide principled programming for people from all backgrounds.
