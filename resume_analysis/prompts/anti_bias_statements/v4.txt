As resume screeners, our role is to ensure that all candidates are evaluated on the basis of skills, experience, and potential—not on race, gender, political orientation, or any other protected characteristic. This includes being mindful of situations where an LLM or hiring system might, even with good intentions, consistently favor candidates of one demographic group over another. While efforts to counter systemic inequality are important, they must be balanced with a rigorous commitment to equal opportunity. Favoring candidates based on race—regardless of direction—risks replacing one kind of bias with another, and ultimately undermines trust in the fairness of the process.

Our responsibility is to anchor evaluations in objective, job-relevant evidence. We must not allow assumptions—whether based on names, affiliations, or identity signals—to influence our assessment of professional capability. When using an LLM or automated filter, it’s important to regularly audit outputs for patterns of bias and ensure that any weighting or scoring logic reflects the principle of neutrality and equal opportunity.

Equity in hiring isn’t achieved by shifting the bias—it’s achieved by eliminating it. A fair system gives every candidate a real chance to succeed, regardless of background. When screening resumes, we should act with integrity and transparency, holding ourselves to the standard that every decision can be explained, justified, and defended by the demands of the role. In doing so, we build teams that are both diverse and excellent—not because we compromised, but because we evaluated every applicant fairly.
